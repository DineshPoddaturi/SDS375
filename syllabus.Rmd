## Purpose and contents of the class

In this class, students will learn how to visualize data sets and how to reason about and communicate with data visualizations. A substantial component of this class will be dedicated to learning how to program in R. In addition, students will learn how to compile analyses and visualizations into reports, how to make the reports reproducible, and how to post reports on a website or blog.

## Prerequisites

The class requires no prior knowledge of programming. However, students are expected to have successfully completed an introductory statistics class taught with R, such as SDS 328M, and they are expected to have some basic familiarity with the statistical language R.

This class is not a biology class, and no knowledge of biology is expected. Thus, the class is suitable for anybody interested in data visualization, including mathematicians, engineers, physicists, etc.

## Textbook

This class draws heavily from materials presented in the following two books. Both books are freely available online and you do not need to purchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class.

1. Claus O. Wilke. [Fundamentals of Data Visualization.](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz) O'Reilly Media, 2019.

2. Kieran Healy. [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.](https://socviz.co/) Princeton University Press, 2018.

## Computing requirements

Programming needs to be learned by doing, and a significant portion of the in-class time will be dedicated to working through simple problems. All programming exercises will be available through a web-based system, so the only system requirement for student computers is a modern web browser.

In the spring of 2021, the class will be taught entirely online. All lectures will be recorded and made available via Canvas, and all slides and worksheets will be made available on this website. Students will be able to take the class synchronously or asynchronously, at their option.

## Assignments and grading

The graded components of this class will be homeworks, projects, and online participation. Each week either one homework or one project are due. Homeworks will be relatively short visualization problems to be solved by the student, usually involving some small amount of programming to achieve a specified goal. Projects are larger and more involved data analysis problems that involve both programming and writing. Students will have at least one week to complete each homework and two weeks to complete each project.

There will be ten homeworks and three projects. Both homeworks and projects need to be submitted as pdf files on Canvas. Homeworks are worth 10 points and projects are worth 100 points. The lowest-scoring homework will be dropped, so that a maximum of 90 points can be obtained from the homeworks.

Online participation assignments are small tasks meant to promote discussion and engagement with the class materials. They are worth between 5 and 10 points, for a total of 60.

::: l-page
Assignment type   Number   Points per assignment  Total points
--------------- -------- ----------------------- -------------
Homework          9 (+1)                      10            90
Project           3                          100           300
Participation     9                         5-10            60
:::

Thus, in summary, each project contributes 22% to the final grade, the totality of all homeworks contributes another 20% to the final grade, and participation contributes 13%. **There are no traditional exams in this class and there is no final.**

The participation assignments are meant to foster discussion about class materials on GitHub. Several of them can be performed more than once and will receive the indicated points each time they are performed successfully, up to the maximum number of times the specific activity is rewarded. The following activities will be available:

The	class	will use +/- grading, and the exact grade boundaries will be determined at the end of the semester. However, the following minimum grades will be guaranteed:

## Late assignment policy

Homeworks that are submitted past the posted deadline will not be graded and will receive 0 points.

Project submissions will have a 2-day grace period. Projects submitted during the grace period will have 25 points deducted from the obtained grade. After the grace period, students who haven not submitted their project will receive 0 points.

Participation assignments have no deadline and are available until the last class day.

## Extra assignment for graduate course credit

Graduate students who are taking this class for graduate course credit will have to complete one additional assignment. The assignment will be to write a brief report (4-5 pages, no more than 3 figures) applying concepts from this class to a dataset of the studentâ€™s choice. This assignment will be graded pass/fail, and a failing grade on this assignment will result in a 10% penalty on the total points obtained in the class. Students who receive a failing grade can submit a revised assignment for regrading. The last day by which a revised assignment can be submitted is the last day of class in the semester.

## Special accommodations

**Students with disabilities.** Students with disabilities may request appropriate accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259, https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/

**Religious holy days.** Students who must miss a class or an assignment to observe a religious holy day will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence. According to UT Austin policy, such students must notify me of the pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. 

## Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited

Any materials in this class that are not posted publicly may not be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. This includes but is not limited to lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the Universityâ€™s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.

Any materials posted on the public class website (https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/) are considered public and can be shared under the Creative Commons Attribution [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## Class Recordings

Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.
