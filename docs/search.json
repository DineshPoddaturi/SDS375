Materials provided are subject to change until the class starts in January 2021.\nPurpose and contents of the class\nIn this class, students will learn how to visualize data sets and how to reason about and communicate with data visualizations. A substantial component of this class will be dedicated to learning how to program in R. In addition, students will learn how to compile analyses and visualizations into reports, how to make the reports reproducible, and how to post reports on a website or blog.\nPrerequisites\nThe class requires no prior knowledge of programming. However, students are expected to have successfully completed an introductory statistics class taught with R, such as SDS 328M, and they are expected to have some basic familiarity with the statistical language R.\nThis class is not a biology class, and no knowledge of biology is expected. Thus, the class is suitable for anybody interested in data visualization, including mathematicians, engineers, physicists, etc.\nTextbook\nThis class draws heavily from materials presented in the following two books. Both books are freely available online and you do not need to purchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class.\nClaus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data Visualization. O’Reilly Media, 2019.\nKieran Healy. Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.

All programming exercises will be available through a web-based system, so the only system requirement for student computers is a modern web browser.\nIn the spring of 2021, the class will be taught entirely online. All lectures will be recorded and made available via Canvas, and all slides and worksheets will be made available on this website. Students will be able to take the class synchronously or asynchronously, at their option.\nAssignments and grading\nThe graded components of this class will be homeworks and projects. Each week either one homework or one project are due. Homeworks will be relatively short visualization problems to be solved by the student, usually involving some small amount of programming to achieve a specified goal. Projects are larger and more involved data analysis problems that involve both programming and writing. Students will have at least one week to complete each homework and two weeks to complete each project.\nThe exact homework and project schedule will be published soon. There will likely be 10–12 homeworks and 3–4 projects, for a total of 14–15 assignments.\nLate assignment policy\nTBD\nExtra assignment for graduate course credit\nGraduate students who are taking this class for graduate course credit will have to complete one additional assignment. The assignment will be to write a brief report (4-5 pages, no more than 3 figures) applying concepts from this class to a dataset of the student’s choice. This assignment will be graded pass/fail, and a failing grade on this assignment will result in a 10% penalty on the total points obtained in the class. Students who receive a failing grade can submit a revised assignment for regrading. The last day by which a revised assignment can be submitted is the last day of class in the semester.\nSpecial accommodations\nStudents with disabilities. Students with disabilities may request appropriate accommodations from the Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259, https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/\nReligious holy days. Students who must miss a class or an assignment to observe a religious holy day will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence. According to UT Austin policy, such students must notify me of the pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day.\n\n\n\n",
